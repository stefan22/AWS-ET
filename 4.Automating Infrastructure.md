## Implementing Elasticity
		
###		Bootstrapping

		- Bootstrapping refers to creating a self-sustaining startup process that can run on its own
		- In the context of AWS, it means the process needed to get your app running on an EC2 instance
		- Tell instances who they are and what role -ie: app server, db server
		- These instances should be able to grab needed resources -ie code files, configuration, utility scripts
		- all of it, based on the role they're playing then register itself as a component in the system

###		Sample Bootstrap Process

		- Mount needed drives
		- start needed services
		- update code files or pull down needed scripts
		- update software or apply needed patches
		- register itself with load balancer
		- start receiving traffic

### 	Bootstrapping tools

		- run custom scripts and tools
		- Chef/ Puppet
		- Opswork (free application management service avail in AWS) - built on top of the chef framework
		- Access to instance metadata
		- Cloud-Init (Linux)       //also avail through AWS
		- EC2Config (for Windows servers)      //also avail through AWS


###     Auto-Scaling groups

		- A service focus on helping you implement elasticity (not too much and too much capacity) where
		  the solution is to take advantage of the elastic nature of the cloud, and to increase capacity
		  when load demands, and to decrease capacity when load lightens
		- Auto-scaling makes this easy. You define the conditions on which you want to scale out, or in,
		  your EC2 instances. And the auto-scaling service will add, remove, instances when these conditions
		  are met.
			 
			- lets say if average CPU utilization rises above 75% say for more than a minute, add two more
			   instances so without you doing anything you have scale system out to accomodate increased
			   demand.

		- Auto-Scaling 3 main components:

			- launch configuration: what to scale (what EC2 instance size to use, what AMI to use, security
			   group, storage needs etc)

			 - auto-scaling group: where to launch, and define limits on the number of instances to launch
			   ie: desire capacity number

			 - scaling-policy (optional): how to launch, here u define cloudwatch alarms based on certain metrics
			   breaching specified thresholds.

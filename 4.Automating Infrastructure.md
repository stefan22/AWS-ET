## Implementing Elasticity
		
###		Bootstrapping

		- Bootstrapping refers to creating a self-sustaining startup process that can run on its own
		- In the context of AWS, it means the process needed to get your app running on an EC2 instance
		- Tell instances who they are and what role -ie: app server, db server
		- These instances should be able to grab needed resources -ie code files, configuration, utility scripts
		- all of it, based on the role they're playing then register itself as a component in the system

####		Sample Bootstrap Process

				- Mount needed drives
				- start needed services
				- update code files or pull down needed scripts
				- update software or apply needed patches
				- register itself with load balancer
				- start receiving traffic

#### 		Bootstrapping tools

				- run custom scripts and tools
				- Chef/ Puppet
				- Opswork (free application management service avail in AWS) - built on top of the chef framework
				- Access to instance metadata
				- Cloud-Init (Linux)       //also avail through AWS
				- EC2Config (for Windows servers)      //also avail through AWS

# Cloud Best practices

## Design for failure

	- the idea is that while things will always fail at the individual component level, if you architect
	  your overall system, which is composed of multiple and often redundant components, along with good
	  practices to minimize dependency between these components, you can create a very stable and fairly 
	  fail-proof system.
	- avoid single points of failure - often times there is a single database server being used for the
	  entire system. In AWS, we could take advantage of AWS relational database service and easily set up
	  a failover secondary database server
	
## Implement Elasticity
	
	- Schedule-based proactive scaling
	- Event-based proactive scaling
	- Automate your deployment process
	- streamline your build and config proc

## Loose Coupling

	- Minimize dependencies between componets
	- if a component fails, other continue working
	- ex: several web servers and app servers with a database
	- easy to add or remove components to match demand

## Keep things secure
	
> ### Providers responsibility (in case of AWS -> Amazon)

	- physical security
	- infrastructure
	- equipment
	- keeping customers separate

> ### Your responsibility
			
	- Network level
	- Application level	

> ### Keep things secure

	- protect ur date - use SSL. You can manage SSL Certificates either directly on an EC2 instance
	  or to load balancing level which is recommended if you intend to use multiple EC2 instances to
	  serve similar HTTPS request
	- protect your data at rest - considering encrypting data before you store them on any storage
	  devices. You can also encrypt entire file systems on AWS
	- protect your AWS credentials
	- 2 types of security credentials:
		- AWS access keys
		- X.509 certificates (recommended u rotate keys often)
		- Manage user access control using IAM - is ans AWS service that allows you to create users and
		  manage their permissions by assign them roles and replacing them into groups.
		  Rather than handing out your root account information to everyone that needs access, it is strongly
		  recommended that you create separate users for each person needing access.
		- Secure application - AWS provides security gropus which act as your firewalls to the associated
		  instances.

	- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
			- Windows Azure, Rackspace Cloud

	- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
			- Google App engine, PHP Fog, Heroku

	- Software as a Service (SaaS)
			- Google Apps, Basecamp, Mint


 	## Business Benefits

 		- Minimal upfront infrastructure investment 
 		- Just-in-time infrastructure
 		- Keep cost low by scaling as you go
 		- Maximize efficiency of resources
 		- Only pay for what you use

 	## Technical Benefits

 		- Automation (scriptable API's)
 		- Ability to auto scale
 		- Proactive scaling
 		- Efficient development and improved testability
 		- Disaster recovery

 	## Scalable Architectures

 		- change and adpat to growing or diminishing workload
 		- Scaling out -> adding more capacity - increase on traffic // scaling in the opposite
 		- Scaling up -> add resorces to a single component in order to increase its capacity to handle load
 		  ex. increasing number of cpu's or memory of a database  // scaling down opposite

 	## Elasticity

		- refers to cloud's ability to accomodate changes in load and demand of the system
		- Power to scale computing resources (add/remove servers) easily will ultimate drive most of the benefits of the cloud
		- the  elastic nature of the cloud really changes the way you think about your architecture and designs

	## Letting go of constraints

		- determine what resources u need
		- existing systems may not map directly to the cloud
			if a server type doesn't match your ram needs, distribute the need and rethink your architecture
		- cloud provide building blocks
		- quick and easy change resources

# Designing for failure

	## Virtual servers (EC2) and elastic IP's

			- Amazon Elastic cloud compute (EC2) are your servers in the cloud
			- Almost any type of applications you're going to run in the cloud, it is most likely
			  to need servers
			- Elastic IP addresses are static IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing.
			  An Elastic IP address is created within your account and is not specific to a particular
			  instance. When you create a new elastic IP, you control this address until you choose to
			  explicitly release it.
			- so using Elastic IPs, you can quickly remap and failover to another set of servers so that 
			  your traffic is routed to the new servers. This works well for emergencies but also works 
			  well for rolling out new versions of hardware and software.

	## AWS Regions

			- EC2 instances can be launched in one or more geographical regions
			- Utilize multiple availability zones, and even multiple regions if required. Availability zones
			  are conceptually like logical data centers and by deploying your architecture to multiple
			  availability zones, you can ensure high availability, and recover easily from unforseen disasters.

	## Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

			- An AMI is basically a packaged environment containing software stack, along with all necessary parts
			  to properly set up and boot an EC2 instance.
			- AMIs are your unit of deployment. You specify an AMI when you launch an instance

			### Amazon Machine Image Contents:

				- template for root volume -ex operating system
				- launch permissions - that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances
				- block device mapping - to attach to the instance when launched
				- AWS Console -> creating a new instance > click launch > Step1 Choose AMI (this allow you to start 
				  an instance from an existing Amazon package)

	## Elastic Load Balancing

			- It is a component built to balance the traffic load across multiple EC2 instances and multiple availability
			  zones
			- Achieves greater levels of fault tolerance in your applications
			- Scales request-handling capability automatically to meet the traffic demands of your application
			
			### ELB

				- it can handle the routing and load balancing of your HTTP, HTTPS and TCP traffic to your EC2 instance
				- configure health checks
				- scales dynamically
				- single CNAME for DNS configuration

			
	## Cloudwatch - Resource and Application Monitoring - most of it free of charge

			- Resource and Application monitoring service - without having to install any software
			- Monitor resources immediately and automatically
			- Monitor utilization, performance, demand
			- gather metrics ex. CP utilization, network traffic
			- it allows u to set alarms when specific metrics are breached which can then trigger an action
			- paid plan offers higher frequency monitoring intervals (1 minute) versus 5-minute intervals free plan
			- pre defined metrics
			- monitor aggregate metrics

	## Elastic Block Storage (EBS) Volume Storage

			- If you're running an application on EC2 and this application is storing data on the instance, you
			  need to know about your storage options and how to design to ensure you are able to retain this data
			  in the event an instance were to fail.

			- In AWS storage comes in 2 options: 

						- Elastic Block Storage (Persistent) and	//it persists after instance is terminated
						- Ephemeral Storage (Not Persistent)		// does not survive terminantion


			- EBS are storage resources that you create separately from EC2 instances.
			- Then you attach the EBS volumes to EC2 instances.
			- Once attached you can create a file system or run a database on top of these storage devices.
			- Volumes up to 1TB
			- Attach multiple volumes to a single instance
			- Create point-in time snapshots
			- Copy snapshots across regions
			- Use snapshots to instantiate new volumes
			- In order to make your snapshow complete, you need to pause all writes to the volume otherwise
			  it only captures data that has been written
			- EBS snapshots are stored incrementally
			- Snapshots can also be used to change attributes of existing EBS volumes
			- Snapshots can be used to resize volumes and easy to share

	## Relational Database Service (RDS)

			- In the cae of failure, ensure a safe and quick recovery
			- Set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud
			- you can launch a DB instance and get access to a full featured relational database without having
			  to worry about common admin tasks such as backpus or security management
					
						- create a DB instance
						- specify engine (MySQL, Postgress, SQL Server,Oracle)
						- Specify instance size
						- DB created and available to connect to your application and use CloudWatch
						- Benefits cause you are turning these admin task to Amazon:
								
								- No SSH access
								- No root access
								- Amazon also manages patches, backups, failover etc.
